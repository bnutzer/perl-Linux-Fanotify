Linux::Fanotify
==================

Interface for the Linux fanotify API.
The fanotify API provides notification and interception of filesystem events.

This perl module is documented in its perldoc (see perldoc Linux::Fanotify).
The low level functions are documented in the fanotify(7), fanotify_init(2)
and fanotify_mark(2) man pages; as of today (mid 2014), the relevant
updates have not made their way into the distributions' man page packages,
so you might want to visit the originals at
https://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/
instead.

The "sample/" subdirectory of this distribution contains a few simple
demonstrations of this module.

Installation
============
To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make install
